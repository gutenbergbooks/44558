<h2>THE WONDERFUL STORY<br />
OF<br />
BLUE BEARD.</h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg"
width="51" height="50" alt="M" />
</div><p><span class="dropletter">"M</span>ANY
years ago, a noble castle stood
on the side of a hill, surrounded by
the most beautiful gardens, groves,
and fields. It was the residence of
a man amazingly rich; and who
therefore had the rooms of his castle
furnished with all the elegance that opulence could
obtain.</p>

<p>Almost every one would suppose, that there could
hardly be a happier man than the possessor of so much
wealth, and such a stately dwelling: but it is not in the
power of riches to give happiness; nor can splendor
remove every cause of sorrow and discontent.</p>

<p>It was the misfortune of this gentleman to be somewhat
disfigured, by the extraordinary circumstance of
having a blue beard. His general complexion was fair;
and the hair on his head was of a light brown colour.
It is therefore no wonder that, with a blue beard, his appearance
should be considered so remarkable as to be
almost forbidding; indeed it was thought so strange,
that he was known only by the name of Blue Beard.</p>

<p>One of the chief misfortunes which this deformity produced,
was the unwillingness which every young lady
felt, even to be in his company. It was in vain that his
costly carriages and Arabian horses were continually
admired; it was in vain that his wealth was constantly
mentioned in conversation; none of the young ladies
would speak to him, or meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps one great cause of this aversion arose from
a report that he had had several wives; but no one
seemed to know what had become of any of them.
They had disappeared, but no one knew how.</p>

<p>Amongst the families that lived within a short distance
of his castle, there was an elderly lady and her two
daughters. Both these young ladies were highly accomplished,
and much admired: but the younger of the two
was also thought to be unusually handsome, and was
therefore noticed rather more than her sister. It often
happens, that beauty is a misfortune; because, if a
young lady has not good sense, it will make her vain;
and a vain girl generally falls into some kind of misery
or trouble.</p>

<p>Blue Beard became acquainted with the mother of
these young ladies; who having found that he was a
gentleman of agreeable conversation and pleasing manners,
told her daughters, she would not allow them to be
so rude as to shun any person merely on account of a
circumstance for which he ought not to be blamed nor
despised. She told them that she did not desire them to
like this gentleman either for his wealth or his behaviour;
but that it was improper in them to show such
weakness, as to avoid any one for such a peculiarity;
she reminded them how liable we all are to changes of
appearance, from beauty to ugliness, by diseases which
we can neither prevent nor remove; and that if they
shunned one man because he had a blue beard, they
might also avoid others for having black hair, or grey
eyes.</p>

<p>The young ladies were convinced of the propriety of
what their mamma said; and though they were quite
sure that they could never like Blue Beard, yet they
resolved to remain in the room when he visited their
mother, and to speak to him with proper civility.</p>

<p>After a few days he visited the house again, and had
an opportunity of seeing and conversing with the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
ladies; they treated him with politeness, and their fears
(for they had been somewhat afraid of him) began to
subside. He met them in the same manner two or three
times afterwards; and at length prevailed on the old
lady to come with her daughters to his castle, and there
spend with him a few days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/line2.jpg" width="350" height="14" alt="line" />
</div>

<p>Vanity on their own account, and respect towards Blue
Beard, induced them to make the greatest preparations
for the intended visit. The young ladies thought of
little but the magnificence of the dresses they should
wear, and the taste which should be displayed in every
part of their appearance.</p>

<p>Indeed, if both the young ladies had really been extremely
fond of Blue Beard, they could not have taken
greater pains to show themselves off, than they employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in preparing for their appearance at the castle.
But, in truth, neither of them liked him. Such, however,
is the thoughtless pride of some young ladies,
that scarcely any thing pleases them so well as an
opportunity of surpassing each other in displaying off
their dress, jewels, or other finery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/line2.jpg" width="350" height="14" alt="line" />
</div>

<p>The two young ladies having fully prepared themselves,
they, accompanied by their mamma, on the day
that had been appointed, set out for the castle, and at
length reached the gate that lead through Blue Beard's
grounds; and, although they had heard a great deal
of the taste and expence which had been employed to
improve and decorate the land around the castle, yet
they were surprised by unexpected beauties. The finest
trees overshadowed the walks, and shaded them from
the heat of the sun; the most fragrant shrubs and flowers
perfumed the air; fountains were playing in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
direction; and alcoves were found in every inviting
spot. Having passed through these delightful grounds,
they reached the castle itself; at the entrance of which
they were received by Blue Beard, and a retinue of servants
in the most costly dresses. The hall was large and
very lofty; its roof was supported by pillars of the finest
marble; the windows were of beautiful stained glass;
and upon the walls were hanging the portraits of the
former possessors of this noble building.</p>

</div>

<p>They ascended the staircase, the rails of which were
of brass work, most curiously wrought, and most richly
gilt; the stairs themselves were of Egyptian marble,
covered with crimson velvet. They proceeded into a
drawing room that completely surpassed their ideas of
grandeur; almost every piece of furniture was of silver;
the floor was covered with white velvet, but was
ornamented with needle-work that must have occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
labour of years; the curtains were of satin, but were
adorned in a manner to correspond with the carpets:
in short, every thing was more splendid than words
can describe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/line2.jpg" width="350" height="14" alt="line" />
</div>

<p>The party continued in the castle several days;
during which there was a constant succession of the
most pleasing amusements. Not an interval was allowed
to pass without some kind of entertainment; music,
singing, and dancing; banquets, consisting of every
luxury, were in constant succession.</p>

<p>Blue Beard had not been inattentive to the ladies
in his personal services: he seemed to watch every
look, that he might know how to please his fair visitors.
Such attentions could not fail to produce some favorable
effect; for it seldom happens, that the person who
really desires to please, fails in pleasing.</p>

<p>When they were about to depart, Blue Beard entreated
the younger of the two ladies that have been mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to consent to become his wife. The splendor
of every thing around her, the immense wealth she
would have at command, and the attentions she had
received during her visit, completely captivated the
young lady, so that she no longer felt disposed to resist;
and accordingly, with her mother's approbation,
they were married. She, however, agreed that her sister
should live with her in the castle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/line2.jpg" width="350" height="14" alt="line" />
</div>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the magnificence
with which this event was celebrated. The costly additions
that were made to the furniture; the expensive
dresses that were provided for the bride; and the sumptuous
entertainments that were given to the company
that attended, far exceeded all imaginary description.
Indeed, there was scarcely any thing wanting for which
she could have wished.</p>

<p>A new dining hall was prepared; and all the utensils
of the table used upon the occasion, were manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of pure gold and silver: and persons were sent
many miles to procure the greatest delicacies that could
possibly be obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

</div>

<p>But the greatest solicitude was shown in preparing
the attire of the intended bride. Whatever wealth
could purchase, or ingenuity contrive, were provided to
give to her natural charms all the embellishments which
art could bestow.</p>

<p>Nor was Blue Beard himself unemployed: he not
only gave orders for himself, but all his servants were
provided with the richest clothes, according to their respective
situations.</p>

<p>Numerous as were his horses, additional ones were
purchased; and new carriages of the grandest designs
and the most costly materials, were prepared for his
bride against the approaching happy day.</p>

</div>

<p>When the morning arrived on which this interesting
ceremony was to take place, the day had scarcely dawned
when sounds of joy were heard. The servants arose
to prepare for the series of magnificence that was to take
place; but none of them were moving about earlier than
the bride and bridegroom; who, as they were the most
immediately interested, were also the most anxious, and
therefore among the most early, in preparing for the
events of the day.</p>

<p>The company assembled to breakfast, and every thing
marked the magnificence of the occasion; and every
countenance contributed to the general cheerfulness.
The church in which the ceremony was to take place
was at some distance. The company proceeded thither
in ten carriages, each drawn by six horses, and attended
by a great retinue of servants. The carriage in which
the bride and bridegroom were seated, was drawn by
Arabian horses; the harness was made of white silk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
woven on purpose; the trappings were of pure silver;
the carriage itself was chiefly formed of pearl, ivory,
and silver; and was lined with white satin, beautifully
embossed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

</div>

<p>When the procession approached the church, it was
met by one hundred young maidens, dressed in white,
singing to a band of the most skilful musicians: and
when the company alighted, the young maidens strewed
flowers for them to walk upon.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, they returned in the
same manner, and were treated with the same complimentary
services: that the hearts of all might rejoice,
the bride and bridegroom distributed money as they
passed along.</p>

<p>The dinner far exceeded in sumptuousness all that
imagination can conceive. In the different recesses of
this noble apartment, artificial fountains were playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the most odoriferous waters. The most luxuriant fruit-trees,
standing in vases of gold, invited the guests to
pluck the delicious fruits they bore.</p>

</div>

<p>In the evening, the company were introduced to a
ball room. But so resplendent was this saloon, that on
entering it, the eye was subdued by its incomparable
radiance.</p>

<p>Transparencies, executed by the most eminent painters,
charmed the attentive mind on every side; and the
intervening spaces were filled up with variegated lamps,
all of which were hung upon the surface of reflecting
glass; while from the centre of the ceiling, a chandelier,
suspended by a chain of gold, diffused the splendor
of five hundred wax-lights. Here, also, were fountains
of aromatic waters, and groves of exotic fruit-trees.</p>

<p>In this apartment, which seemed to realize the fabled
stories of enchantment, dancing, and every other
description of amusement, was continued, until folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
windows opened, as if of their own accord, and disclosed
a covered path through the most delightful part of the
gardens, to a room in which supper was prepared: this
path was entirely illuminated by splendid lamps; and
the most brilliant fireworks were unremittingly discharged
by artists engaged for the purpose.</p>

<p>The bride seemed to think that her life must necessarily
consist of pleasure and happiness: indeed, she
could imagine nothing that could be wanting to complete
her wishes.</p>

<p>The utmost expectations of the young wife were fully
gratified: every thing that she could wish for was hers,
and her husband behaved with a kindness which made
her feel truly happy.</p>

</div>

<p>Some time after the marriage had taken place, however,
Blue Beard informed his wife that he had occasion
to take a journey on account of some business, to which
he must attend; "but I beg you, my dearest Fatima,
(for that was the young lady's name,) to have every
sort of entertainment that can amuse you during my
absence. Here are all the keys of the castle; you may
therefore examine the different apartments which you
have not seen; and I hope you will find some that will
surprise and please you as well as those with which
you are already acquainted. I must however most
earnestly caution and require you not to open the blue
closet at the end of the gallery; and although I leave
the key of it with you, yet I trust you will have the
prudence to fulfil my wishes in this particular.
Remember this, as you value my love and your own life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and happiness."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/line2.jpg" width="350" height="14" alt="line" />
</div>

<p>Fatima promised that she would obey his desire.
She thanked her husband for his kind attention to her
comforts; and again promised that she would not disappoint
the confidence he had placed in her, but would
carefully abstain from examining the particular apartment
he had named.</p>

<p>Blue Beard set off upon his journey; and Fatima
having informed her sister of every thing that had passed
in their late conversation, they agreed to invite their
relatives and friends to an entertainment the next day;
but more particularly their two brothers, who, having
been absent from home as military officers, had not yet
seen their sister's magnificent residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Having arranged every thing for their intended party,
Fatima proposed that they should see the apartments
of which she now had the keys. They accordingly
proceeded to that part of the extensive castle which
they had not as yet seen, and at last arrived at a most
splendid suit of rooms, far surpassing those to which
they had been accustomed.</p>

<p>On one side of one of these apartments they perceived
a door, which they opened, and found behind it an iron
gate of amazing strength. Among the keys Blue Beard
had left, they found one which opened this massy portal.</p>

<p>When they entered the room which was before them,
they were surprised to find it almost full of large iron
chests: but their surprise was considerably increased
when they had found, that they were full of gold, silver,
and jewels; even the costliness of the apartments they
had just quitted, seemed insignificant when compared
with the riches which this treasury contained.</p>

<p>Having fastened the entrance to the treasury, they
sat down and conversed upon what they had seen.
Fatima could not avoid feeling that the personal
deformity in Blue Beard was compensated by the vast
wealth of which she was become the mistress; but
both she and her sister were almost lost in admiration
of the immeasurable riches they had lately beheld.</p>

<p>In returning to their usual apartments, they passed
the door of the mysterious blue closet, which Blue
Beard had cautioned his wife not to examine. They
could not help expressing their mutual curiosity upon
the interior of this particular chamber. It could not
have been his wish to conceal any articles of value;
as nothing could be more valuable than the contents of
the treasury. After some deliberation, Fatima said that
they could do no harm by merely looking inside; and
although her sister reminded her of the promise she had
made her husband, and of his express desire, yet she
resolved to gratify her irresistible curiosity, and put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
key to the door.</p>

<p>She entered the closet, but it was too dark for her to
discern any object; however, she could just perceive
that there was a window, the shutters of which were
closed: she went forward and removed them. The
instant that light was admitted, her curiosity was gratified.
She found herself amidst the severed limbs and
mutilated bodies of her husband's former wives. The
scene was frightful! Her own future condition, she
immediately thought, might add to these dreadful objects!
Her blood chilled! The very hair rose upon
her head! Nor was her terror diminished, when she
saw upon the wall these awful words&mdash;<em>The fate of
broken promises and disobedient curiosity.</em>&mdash;She
trembled excessively; and in the alarm of the moment,
she let fall the key of the closet, which she had brought
in her hand: she hastily snatched it from the floor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and having summoned sufficient courage to close the
shutters, she came out of this dreadful apartment, and
locked the door.</p>

<p>Fatima hastened to her sister, who not choosing to
partake of her sister's folly, had proceeded to their
customary sitting-room. She related what she had seen;
particularly the sentence which was on the wall. Her
sister partook of her alarm; and feared that evil
consequences would result from this unfortunate affair.
She asked Fatima if she had closed the window-shutters
and brought away the key: and returned every
thing she had moved to its proper place; Fatima said
she had; and, in proof of her answer to the inquiry,
showed the key itself.</p>

<p>The key, however, was no sooner produced than they
both turned pale with horror. This fatal instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was covered with blood! and all their endeavours could
not clear it of its condemning evidence.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the evening they employed
themselves in making every sort of exertion to restore
the key to its former state; but all they could do was
ineffectual; it still preserved the testimony of Fatima's
indiscretion. At night they retired to bed; but no sleep
did the wretched girls obtain. The splendor and riches
of the castle lost all their charms; Fatima no longer
prided herself upon her good fortune; she felt that no
creature could be more miserable than she was. How
soon Blue Beard would return, she had no means of
conjecturing; it was not likely, however, that he would
be at the castle again for some days to come; she therefore
resolved to escape from this dreadful mansion as
soon as the entertainment, which was appointed for the
next day, should have taken place.</p>

<p>When she arose in the morning, she communicated
to her sister the intention she had formed; and they
both began to feel less dread than they had experienced
since the discoveries in the fatal closet. The day advanced,
and they looked forward to the arrival of the
relatives and friends whom they had invited to this
day's entertainment.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of their mutual congratulations
upon the plan which had been formed, they heard the
arrival of a carriage at the castle, and in a few moments
Blue Beard himself entered their apartment. Fatima
felt all the horror which the remembrance of the closet
could excite, and all the shame which the consciousness
of her own impropriety could not fail to produce.</p>

<p>Blue Beard did not seem to notice his wife's uneasiness;
but with apparent good humour said, "that he
had not proceeded very far, when he met a messenger
who was coming to the castle to inform him that it was
no longer necessary he should proceed on his intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
journey; that he had therefore lost no time in returning
home; where," he said, "Fatima's presence rendered
him so peculiarly happy."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Blue Beard, as though he wanted
something, asked his wife for the keys. She went to
the chamber and returned with all of them excepting
the one which belonged to the dreadful closet; for it
still preserved the evidence of her disobedience. He
took them with seeming good-natured indifference, and
did not pretend to observe how the wretched girl trembled.
As he held them in his hand, he said to her, with
affected carelessness, "The key of the blue closet is not
here; bring it to me in my dressing-room."</p>

<p>He arose and left the apartment in which they were
sitting; and Fatima and her sister proceeded to her
chamber. Again they tried to remove the blood with
which the key was stained; but all their efforts were
unavailing. At length Blue Beard called his wife, and
as she and her sister were going to his dressing-room,
they met him in the gallery, close to the stairs which led
to the top of the castle.</p>

<p>As soon as she approached him, he threw off the disguise
of good nature which he had assumed in the sitting
room, and demanded the key of the closet. The
tone of voice in which this was uttered, struck upon her
ear like the knell for her execution; she seemed to be
deprived of the power of speaking. He became impatient,
and seizing her hand, took from it the blood-stained
key. The wretched girl fell upon her knees, the tears
rushed into her eyes, and enabled her to speak; but by
this time Blue Beard stood over her with his sword
unsheathed.</p>

<p>Fatima's sister, as she stood by, almost petrified, gave
a dreadful shriek when she saw the instrument of death
raised over her defenceless sister. The sound caught
the ear of Blue Beard; and for a moment his intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was suspended. Looking upon his wretched victim,
"Where," said he, "was your promise, when you were
fool enough to enter the closet? and where was the obedience
you promised to pay me, when you suffered your
curiosity to overcome your duty? But you shall commit
no more crimes; therefore receive <em>the fate of broken
promises, and disobedient curiosity</em>."</p>

<p>These last words roused the almost inanimate girl;
she recollected that she had seen them on the wall of the
fatal closet. He was now about to fulfil his sentence;
his arm was again uplifted; when she entreated him to
spare her for a few minutes, to prepare for this unexpected
end. He consented, after much entreaty, to allow
her a quarter of an hour. As soon as this indulgence
was given her, she begged her sister to ascend the staircase
to the top of the castle, and see if any of their
friends were to be seen. She did so; but no signs of a
human being could be perceived.</p>

<p>At length the short interval which had been allowed
her came to an end, and Blue Beard approached to complete
his determination. She again implored mercy, and
he, knowing that she was in his power, gave her five
minutes more. She now renewed her frenzied enquiries
to her sister; "Is no one coming?" asked she.
After a short time her sister told her that she saw something
approaching; which cheered the heart of the unhappy
girl. Alas! it was but transient,&mdash;it was a flock
of sheep.</p>

<p>Blue Beard's patience was now exhausted; and he
came to the foot of the tower where Fatima was; when
her sister called out, "I see two horsemen coming."
"Make signs for them to hasten," shrieked the miserable
girl.</p>

<p>Her brutal husband had now caught her by the hair
of her head, and in spite of her heart-rending cries for
mercy, was about to strike at her with his scymitar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when two men in soldiers' uniform rushed to the spot,
and plunged their swords in the breast of the relentless
Blue Beard.</p>

<p>The monster had still sufficient life to speak: he raised
himself on one arm, and looking on them all, thus
spoke: "I am at last justly punished. By the splendor
of my riches, I have induced many a beautiful woman
to become my wife; but as soon as I discovered the
least deviation from truth, or disobedience to my will,
she suffered death. I put Fatima's veracity to the test,
by obtaining her promise that she would not open the
door of the blue closet; and by leaving the key with
her, she broke her word, and the key, which has the
property of preserving the stains of blood, until it be
rubbed with a peculiar oil, afforded the evidence of her
guilt. By the same means I knew that she had disobeyed
my orders, and broken her own promises. These
two faults had incurred my revenge. She has had a
narrow escape; yet I hope she will in future never
break a promise, disobey those to whom she promises
submission, nor give way to the impulse of improper or
forbidden curiosity."</p>

<p>He grew faint; and having uttered a few prayers for
forgiveness, he fell back, and expired.</p>

<p>During the day, all the friends who had been invited
arrived. They were told the occurrences which had
happened; and such of them as chose it, saw the horrid
proofs of Blue Beard's cruelty.</p>

<p>Fatima shortly afterwards had a day of great rejoicing;
she not only gave a magnificent entertainment to
her relations and friends, but the poor, for miles round,
were collected together to partake of her hospitality:
and on this occasion every face glowed with smiles
of happiness.</p>

<p>Fatima's former days had showed her the sufferings
and privations of the poor; and now she had the power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
she determined to better their condition. With this
view, instead of the miserable hovels usually inhabited
by the labouring poor, she had annually several comfortable
and pleasant cottages built, and to each one she
added, a large plot of ground. To every labouring
family upon her extensive estates, she gave one of these
cottages, and where there were a family of children, she
added to this gift a cow, and a few sheep. By this
means, she enabled them, by their own exertions, instead
of occasional want, always to secure a humble
competence; and in a very short time, every person
upon her estate was rendered happy, and became her
firm friend.</p>
